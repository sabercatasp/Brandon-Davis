		<p>I am currently the Marketing/Proposal Coordinator for Thomas & Marker Construction in Columbus, Ohio. I graduated from Marietta College with a Bachelor of Arts in Organizational Communications and Public Relations, with minors in Marketing and Leadership Studies.<p>
		As you will see in my resume, I have gained a wide range of experiences and over three years of professional development, thanks in part to my past internships and current position. My internships have afforded me the chance to: create, manage and post content to client’s social media platforms; be a research team member for development of a brand new app (columbusinternships.com); meet with and discuss client’s brand identity and strategy; and perform independent research, analyzing and providing clients with vital marketing data. Currently, for Thomas & Marker (T&M) I am responsible for our social media content, keeping materials within the brand standards and marketing strategy. Also, I prepare and coordinate submittal packages in response to requests for proposals. I communicate with business development, division and project managers, as well as consultants to ensure accuracy of content. To accomplish these tasks, I use services such as Adobe Suite, MailChimp, Cosential and Hootsuite. With T&M being split between two offices and seven divisions, it is imperative that I stay proactive to ensure all tasks meet deadlines, are completed efficiently and exceed company standards. <p>
		While working full time, I have obtained a certification in Google Analytics, taken classes in HTML and CSS, and pursued other educational opportunities. In addition, by creating social media content for many different organizations over the years, I am positioned to help create strategies that reach and speak to the audiences you serve. By utilizing this acquired knowledge, I believe I can assist DHL in achieving its goals in helping create and implement digital communication strategies that increase brand awareness.
